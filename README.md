📊 Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains the second task of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset using Python.

🔍 Objective:
To explore the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations in order to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

📈 Key Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset

Analyzed correlations between features and target variables

Visualized distributions, relationships, and survival rates using plots

Identified important factors influencing outcomes

📌 Example Insights (if using Titanic dataset):
Females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates

Children under 10 had better chances of survival

Higher ticket fares were associated with better outcomes

Solo travelers had lower survival compared to family groups

Embarkation point (Cherbourg) correlated with higher survival

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Files Included:
Task2_EDA.ipynb: Full notebook with code, visualizations, and insights

dataset.csv: The dataset used for analysis (if included)

📌 This project strengthened my skills in:

Data cleaning

Feature analysis

Insight extraction through visual storytelling
